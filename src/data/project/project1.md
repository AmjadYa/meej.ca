## You should do your labs.

This project was the culmination of **eight** labs that gave us the necessary background to create a fully autonomous, line-following robot for the end of the semester. You can read a logbook I made for all the labs (and random thoughts) which I created [here](/public/pdfs/Amjad%20Yaghi%20individual%20logbook.pdf). 

## Key visuals:
